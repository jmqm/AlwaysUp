Keeping files alive.

## About this project.
Using AnonFiles.com, files are uploaded and a corresponding text file is created with the link to the file. If a link goes down, the file is uploaded again and the text file's link changed.

This project was a fun idea I wanted to create. In no way do I support the distribution of illegal material.
